This module will not change much, the idea below will be implemented in
another module (see subscription.module).

- subscribe to other node types
    alert should be sent: - on update of a node
                          - if a comment gets added

  Memo: This is best done by specifying a standard behaviour
        that can be overwritten and extended by modules with
        specific needs (event.module for example).
        The alert times should get into a separate table then.
