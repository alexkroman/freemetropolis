CHANGELOG, last updated 2004-03-02

This document contains the changelog for
SmartyPants-PHP, a "quote educator" library
based on John Gruber's SmartyPants plug-in.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.4.1-php-r2    2004-03-02    changed $tags_to_skip to define()d value
                              to avoid scope problems (in calling SmartyPants()
                              from inside a function)

                              changed $VERSION to define()d value to avoid
                              namespace collisions with other libraries

                              added test to have SmartyPonts and EducateQuotes
                              functions return immediately if $text is empty

                              added link to Smarty output filter for 
                              SmartyPants-PHP to README

                              Thanks to Joe Stump <http://www.jcssolutions.com> 
                              for the feedback and Smarty output filter.

1.4.1-php       2004-02-21    initial release
