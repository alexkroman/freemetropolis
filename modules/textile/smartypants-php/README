    Version 1.4.1php-r2
    '1.4.1' mirrors the SmartyPants version number; 'r2' indicates 'release 2'
    Release date: 2 March 2004
    
    Much information about punctuation conversion, and the
    complexities and limitations thereof, can be found in the 
    original SmartyPants documentation, included below.
    
    Code specific to BBEdit, Movable Type, and Blosxom has been
    stripped out. The punctuation conversion routines have been
    made available as a library of PHP functions.
    
    Most users will simply pass HTML strings to SmartyPants(),
    and get back the same string with punctuation "educated."
    
    To access non-default behavior, pass a second parameter
    to SmartyPants: an integer value created by OR'ing together
    any of the following command mode values:
    
    DO_QUOTES
    DO_BACKTICKS_DOUBLE
    DO_BACKTICKS_ALL
    DO_DASHES
    DO_OLDSCHOOL_DASHES
    DO_INVERTED_OLDSCHOOL_DASHES
    DO_ELLIPSES
    DO_QUOT_CONV
    DO_STUPEFY
    
    For example, to convert dashes and ellipses only:
    $mode = DO_DASHES | DO_ELLIPSES;
    $new_html = SmartyPants($old_html, $mode);
    
    To back-convert "smart" punctuation to ASCII, either
    pass DO_STUPEFY in the 2nd argument to SmartyPants,
    or call the utility function directly:
    $uneducated = StupefyEntities($educated);

    To use SmartyPants-PHP in conjunction with Smarty, 
    you might find this Smarty output filter useful:

SmartyPants
===========

    Version 1.4.1 - Sat 8 Nov 2003


    SmartyPants is a free web publishing plug-in for Movable Type, Blosxom,
    and BBEdit that easily translates plain ASCII punctuation characters
    into "smart" typographic punctuation HTML entities.

    SmartyPants can perform the following transformations:

    *   Straight quotes ( " and ' ) into "curly" quote HTML entities

    *   Backticks-style quotes (``like this'') into "curly" quote HTML
        entities

    *   Dashes ("--" and "---") into en- and em-dash entities

    *   Three consecutive dots ("...") into an ellipsis entity

    This means you can write, edit, and save your posts using plain old
    ASCII straight quotes, plain dashes, and plain dots, but your published
    posts (and final HTML output) will appear with smart quotes, em-dashes,
    and proper ellipses.

    SmartyPants is a combination plug-in -- the same file works with Movable
    Type, Blosxom, and BBEdit. It can also be used from a Unix-style
    command-line. Version requirements and installation instructions for
    each of these tools can be found in the corresponding sub-section under
    "Installation", below.

    SmartyPants does not modify characters within "<pre>", "<code>",
    "<kbd>", or "<script>" tag blocks. Typically, these tags are used to
    display text where smart quotes and other "smart punctuation" would not
    be appropriate, such as source code or example markup.

**Backslash Escapes**

    If you need to use literal straight quotes (or plain hyphens and
    periods), SmartyPants accepts the following backslash escape sequences
    to force non-smart punctuation. It does so by transforming the escape
    sequence into a decimal-encoded HTML entity:

                  Escape  Value  Character
                  ------  -----  ---------
                    \\    &#92;    \
                    \"    &#34;    "
                    \'    &#39;    '
                    \.    &#46;    .
                    \-    &#45;    -
                    \`    &#96;    `

    This is useful, for example, when you want to use straight quotes as
    foot and inch marks: 6'2" tall; a 17" iMac.

**MT-Textile Integration**

    Movable Type users should also note that SmartyPants can work in
    conjunction with Brad Choate's MT-Textile plug-in:

        http://bradchoate.com/past/mttextile.php

    MT-Textile is a port of Dean Allen's original Textile project to Perl
    and Movable Type. MT-Textile by itself only translates Textile markup to
    HTML. However, if SmartyPants is also installed, MT-Textile will call on
    SmartyPants to educate quotes, dashes, and ellipses, automatically.
    Using SmartyPants in conjunction with MT-Textile requires no
    modifications to your Movable Type templates.

    Textile is Dean Allen's "humane web text generator", an easy-to-write
    and easy-to-read shorthand for writing text for the web. An online
    Textile web application is available at Mr. Allen's site:

        http://textism.com/tools/textile/


Installation
------------
**Movable Type**

    SmartyPants works with Movable Type version 2.5 or later.

    1.  Copy the "SmartyPants.pl" file into your Movable Type "plugins"
        directory. The "plugins" directory should be in the same directory
        as "mt.cgi"; if it doesn't already exist, use your FTP program to
        create it. Your installation should look like this:

            (mt home)/plugins/SmartyPants.pl

    2.  If you're using SmartyPants with Brad Choate's MT-Textile, you're
        done.

        If not, to activate SmartyPants on your weblog, you need to edit
        your MT templates. The easiest way is to add the "smarty_pants"
        attribute to each MT template tag whose contents you wish to apply
        SmartyPants' transformations. Obvious tags would include
        "MTEntryTitle", "MTEntryBody", and "MTEntryMore". SmartyPants should
        work within any MT content tag.

        For example, to apply SmartyPants to your entry titles:

            <$MTEntryTitle smarty_pants="1"$>

        The value passed to "smarty_pants" specifies the way SmartyPants
        works. See "Options", below, for full details on all of the
        supported options.

**Blosxom**

    SmartyPants works with Blosxom version 2.0 or later.

    1.  Rename the "SmartyPants.pl" plug-in to "SmartyPants" (case is
        important). Movable Type requires plug-ins to have a ".pl"
        extension; Blosxom forbids it (at least as of this writing).

    2.  Copy the "SmartyPants" plug-in file to your Blosxom plug-ins folder.
        If you're not sure where your Blosxom plug-ins folder is, see the
        Blosxom documentation for information.

    3.  That's it. The entries in your weblog should now automatically have
        SmartyPants' default transformations applied.

    4.  If you wish to configure SmartyPants' behavior, open the
        "SmartyPants" plug-in, and edit the value of the $smartypants_attr
        configuration variable, located near the top of the script. The
        default value is 1; see "Options", below, for the full list of
        supported values.

**BBEdit**

    SmartyPants works with BBEdit 6.1 or later on Mac OS X; and BBEdit 5.1
    or later on Mac OS 9 or earlier (provided you have MacPerl installed).

    1.  Copy the "SmartyPants.pl" file to appropriate filters folder in your
        "BBEdit Support" folder. On Mac OS X, this should be:

            BBEdit Support:Unix Support:Unix Filters:

        On Mac OS 9 or earlier, this should be:

            BBEdit Support:MacPerl Support: Perl Filters:

        See the BBEdit documentation for more details on the location of
        these folders.

        You can rename "SmartyPants.pl" to whatever you wish.

    2.  That's it. To use SmartyPants, select some text in a BBEdit
        document, then choose SmartyPants from the Filters sub-menu or the
        Filters floating palette. On Mac OS 9, the Filters sub-menu is in
        the "Camel" menu; on Mac OS X, it is in the "#!" menu.

    3.  If you wish to configure SmartyPants' behavior, open the SmartyPants
        file and edit the value of the $smartypants_attr configuration
        variable, located near the top of the script. The default value is
        1; see "Options", below, for the full list of supported values.


Options
-------
  smarty_pants

    For MT users, the "smarty_pants" template tag attribute is where you
    specify configuration options. For Blosxom and BBEdit users, settings
    are specified by editing the value of the $smartypants_attr variable in
    the script itself.

    Numeric values are the easiest way to configure SmartyPants' behavior:

    "0" Suppress all transformations. (Do nothing.)

    "1" Performs default SmartyPants transformations: quotes (including
        ``backticks'' -style), em-dashes, and ellipses. "--" (dash dash) is
        used to signify an em-dash; there is no support for en-dashes.

    "2" Same as smarty_pants="1", except that it uses the old-school
        typewriter shorthand for dashes: "--" (dash dash) for en-dashes,
        "---" (dash dash dash) for em-dashes.

    "3" Same as smarty_pants="2", but inverts the shorthand for dashes: "--"
        (dash dash) for em-dashes, and "---" (dash dash dash) for en-dashes.

    "-1"
        Stupefy mode. Reverses the SmartyPants transformation process,
        turning the HTML entities produced by SmartyPants into their ASCII
        equivalents. E.g. "&#8220;" is turned into a simple double-quote
        ("), "&#8212;" is turned into two dashes, etc. This is useful if you
        are using SmartyPants from Brad Choate's MT-Textile text filter, but
        wish to suppress smart punctuation in specific MT templates, such as
        RSS feeds. Text filters do their work before templates are
        processed; but you can use smarty_pants="-1" to reverse the
        transformations in specific templates.

    The following single-character attribute values can be combined to
    toggle individual transformations from within the smarty_pants
    attribute. For example, to educate normal quotes and em-dashes, but not
    ellipses or ``backticks'' -style quotes:

        <$MTFoo smarty_pants="qd"$>

    "q" Educates normal quote characters: (") and (').

    "b" Educates ``backticks'' -style double quotes.

    "B" Educates ``backticks'' -style double quotes and `single' quotes.

    "d" Educates em-dashes.

    "D" Educates em-dashes and en-dashes, using old-school typewriter
        shorthand: (dash dash) for en-dashes, (dash dash dash) for
        em-dashes.

    "i" Educates em-dashes and en-dashes, using inverted old-school
        typewriter shorthand: (dash dash) for em-dashes, (dash dash dash)
        for en-dashes.

    "e" Educates ellipses.

    "w" Translates any instance of "&quot;" into a normal double-quote
        character. This should be of no interest to most people, but of
        particular interest to anyone who writes their posts using
        Dreamweaver, as Dreamweaver inexplicably uses this entity to
        represent a literal double-quote character. SmartyPants only
        educates normal quotes, not entities (because ordinarily, entities
        are used for the explicit purpose of representing the specific
        character they represent). The "w" option must be used in
        conjunction with one (or both) of the other quote options ("q" or
        "b"). Thus, if you wish to apply all SmartyPants transformations
        (quotes, en- and em-dashes, and ellipses) and also translate
        "&quot;" entities into regular quotes so SmartyPants can educate
        them, you should pass the following to the smarty_pants attribute:

            <$MTFoo smarty_pants="qDew"$>

        For Blosxom and BBEdit users, set:

            my $smartypants_attr = "qDew";

**Deprecated MT Attributes**

    The following Movable Type attributes are supported only for
    compatibility with older versions of SmartyPants. They are obsoleted by
    the "smarty_pants" attribute, which offers more control than these
    individual attributes. If you're setting up SmartyPants for the first
    time, you should use the "SmartyPants" attribute instead.

    Blosxom and BBEdit users should simply ignore this section.

   smart_quotes
    The smart_quotes attribute accepts the following values:

    "0" Suppress all quote education. (Do nothing.)

    "1" Default behavior. Educates normal quote characters: (") and (').

    "2" Educate ``backticks'' -style double quotes (in addition to educating
        regular quotes). Transforms each instance of two consecutive
        backtick characters (``) into an opening double-quote, and each
        instance of two consecutive apostrophes ('') into a closing
        double-quote.

   smart_dashes
    The smart_dashes attribute accepts the following values:

    "0" Suppress dash education. (Do nothing.)

    "1" Default behavior. Transforms each instance of "--" (dash dash) into
        an HTML entity-encoded em-dash.

    "2" Educates both en- and em-dashes, using the old-school typewriter
        shorthand for dashes. Each instance of "--" (dash dash) is turned
        into an HTML entity-encoded en-dash; each instance of "---" (dash
        dash dash) is turned into an em-dash.

    "3" Same as smart_dashes="2", but inverts the shorthand, using "--"
        (dash dash) for em-dashes, and "---" (dash dash dash) for en-dashes.
        Although somewhat counterintuitive in that the longer shortcut is
        used for the shorter dash, this syntax is backwards compatible with
        SmartyPants 1.0's original syntax, which used (dash dash) for
        em-dashes.

   smart_ellipses
    The smart_ellipses attribute accepts the following values:

    "0" Suppress ellipsis education. (Do nothing.)

    "1" Default behavior. Transforms each instance of "..." (dot dot dot)
        into an HTML entity-encoded ellipsis. If there are four consecutive
        dots, SmartyPants assumes this means "full stop" followed by
        "ellipsis".

**Version Info Tag**

    If you include this tag in a Movable Type template:

        <$MTSmartyPantsVersion$>

    it will be replaced with a string representing the version number of the
    installed version of SmartyPants, e.g. "1.2".


Caveats
-------
**Why You Might Not Want to Use Smart Quotes in Your Weblog**

    For one thing, you might not care.

    Most normal, mentally stable individuals do not take notice of proper
    typographic punctuation. Many design and typography nerds, however,
    break out in a nasty rash when they encounter, say, a restaurant sign
    that uses a straight apostrophe to spell "Joe's".

    If you're the sort of person who just doesn't care, you might well want
    to continue not caring. Using straight quotes -- and sticking to the
    7-bit ASCII character set in general -- is certainly a simpler way to
    live.

    Even if you *do* care about accurate typography, you still might want to
    think twice before educating the quote characters in your weblog. One
    side effect of publishing curly quote HTML entities is that it makes
    your weblog a bit harder for others to quote from using copy-and-paste.
    What happens is that when someone copies text from your blog, the copied
    text contains the 8-bit curly quote characters (as well as the 8-bit
    characters for em-dashes and ellipses, if you use these options). These
    characters are not standard across different text encoding methods,
    which is why they need to be encoded as HTML entities.

    People copying text from your weblog, however, may not notice that
    you're using curly quotes, and they'll go ahead and paste the unencoded
    8-bit characters copied from their browser into an email message or
    their own weblog. When pasted as raw "smart quotes", these characters
    are likely to get mangled beyond recognition.

    That said, my own opinion is that any decent text editor or email client
    makes it easy to stupefy smart quote characters into their 7-bit
    equivalents, and I don't consider it my problem if you're using an
    indecent text editor or email client.

**Algorithmic Shortcomings**

	One situation in which quotes will get curled the wrong way is when
	apostrophes are used at the start of leading contractions. For example:
	
		'Twas the night before Christmas.
	
	In the case above, SmartyPants will turn the apostrophe into an opening
	single-quote, when in fact it should be a closing one. I don't think
	this problem can be solved in the general case -- every word processor
	I've tried gets this wrong as well. In such cases, it's best to use the
	proper HTML entity for closing single-quotes (&#8217; or &rsquo;) by
	hand.

    This plug-in effectively obsoletes the technique documented here:

        http://daringfireball.net/2002/08/movable_type_smart_quote_devilry.html

    However, the above instructions may still be of interest if for some
    reason you are still running an older version of Movable Type.


Version History
---------------
    1.4.1: Sat 8 Nov 2003

    +   The bug fix from 1.4 for dashes followed by quotes with no
        intervening spaces now actually works.

    +   "&nbsp;" now counts as whitespace where necessary. (Thanks to
        Greg Knauss for the patch.)


    1.4: Mon 30 Jun 2003

    +   Improved the HTML tokenizer so that it will parse nested <> pairs
        up to five levels deep. Previously, it only parsed up to two
        levels. What we *should* do is allow for any arbitrary level of
        nesting, but to do so, we would need to use Perl's ?? construct
        (see Fried's "Mastering Regular Expressions", 2nd Ed., pp.
        328-331), and sadly, this would only work in Perl 5.6 or later.
        SmartyPants still supports Perl 5.00503. I suppose we could test
        for the version and build a regex accordingly, but I don't think
        I want to maintain two separate patterns.

    +   Thanks to Stepan Riha, the tokenizer now handles HTML comments:
            <!-- comment -->

        and PHP-style processor instructions:
            <?php code ?>

    +   The quote educator now handles situations where dashes are used
        without whitespace, e.g.:

            "dashes"--without spaces--"are tricky"  

    +   Special case for decade abbreviations like this: the '80s.
        This only works for the sequence appostrophe-digit-digit-s.


    1.3: Tue 13 May 2003

    +   Plugged the biggest hole in SmartyPants's smart quotes algorithm.
        Previous versions were hopelessly confused by single-character
        quote tokens, such as:

            <p>"<i>Tricky!</i>"</p>

        The problem was that the EducateQuotes() function works on each
        token separately, with no means of getting surrounding context
        from the previous or next tokens. The solution is to curl these
        single-character quote tokens as a special case, *before* calling
        EducateQuotes().

    +   New single-quotes backtick mode for smarty_pants attribute.
        The only way to turn it on is to include "B" in the configuration
        string, e.g. to translate backtick quotes, dashes, and ellipses:

            smarty_pants="Bde"

    +   Fixed a bug where an opening quote would get curled the wrong way
        if the quote started with three dots, e.g.:

            <p>"...meanwhile"</p>

    +   Fixed a bug where opening quotes would get curled the wrong way
        if there were double sets of quotes within each other, e.g.:

            <p>"'Some' people."</p>

    +   Due to popular demand, four consecutive dots (....) will now be
        turned into an ellipsis followed by a period. Previous versions
        would turn this into a period followed by an ellipsis. If you
        really want a period-then-ellipsis sequence, escape the first
        period with a backslash: \....

    +   Removed "&" from our home-grown punctuation class, since it
        denotes an entity, not a literal ampersand punctuation
        character. This fixes a bug where SmartyPants would mis-curl
        the opening quote in something like this:

            "Éwhatever"

    +   SmartyPants has always had a special case where it looks for
        "'s" in situations like this:

            <i>Custer</i>'s Last Stand

        This special case is now case-insensitive.


    1.2.2: Thu Mar 13, 2003

    +   1.2.1 contained a boneheaded addition which prevented SmartyPants
        from compiling under Perl 5.005. This has been remedied, and is
        the only change from 1.2.1.


    1.2.1: Mon Mar 10, 2003

    +   New "stupefy mode" for smarty_pants attribute. If you set

            smarty_pants="-1"

        SmartyPants will perform reverse transformations, turning HTML
        entities into plain ASCII equivalents. E.g. "Ò" is turned
        into a simple double-quote ("), "Ñ" is turned into two
        dashes, etc. This is useful if you are using SmartyPants from Brad
        Choate's MT-Textile text filter, but wish to suppress smart
        punctuation in specific MT templates, such as RSS feeds. Text
        filters do their work before templates are processed; but you can
        use smarty_pants="-1" to reverse the transformations in specific
        templates.

    +   Replaced the POSIX-style regex character class [:punct:] with an
        ugly hard-coded normal character class of all punctuation; POSIX
        classes require Perl 5.6 or later, but SmartyPants still supports
        back to 5.005.

    +   Several small changes to allow SmartyPants to work when Blosxom
        is running in static mode.


    1.2: Thu Feb 27, 2003

    +   SmartyPants is now a combination plug-in, supporting both
        Movable Type (2.5 or later) and Blosxom (2.0 or later).
        It also works as a BBEdit text filter and standalone
        command-line Perl program. Thanks to Rael Dornfest for the
        initial Blosxom port (and for the excellent Blosxom plug-in
        API).

    +   SmartyPants now accepts the following backslash escapes,
        to force non-smart punctuation. It does so by transforming
        the escape sequence into a decimal-encoded HTML entity: 

              Escape  Value  Character
              ------  -----  ---------
                \\    &#92;    \
                \"    &#34;    "
                \'    &#39;    '
                \.    &#46;    .
                \-    &#45;    -
                \`    &#96;    `

        Note that this could produce different results than previous
        versions of SmartyPants, if for some reason you have an article
        containing one or more of these sequences. (Thanks to Charles
        Wiltgen for the suggestion.)

    +   Added a new option to support inverted en- and em-dash notation:
        "--" for em-dashes, "---" for en-dashes. This is compatible with
        SmartyPants' original "--" syntax for em-dashes, but also allows
        you to specify en-dashes. It can be invoked by using
        smart_dashes="3", smarty_pants="3", or smarty_pants="i". 
        (Suggested by Aaron Swartz.)

    +   Added a new option to automatically convert &quot; entities into
        regular double-quotes before sending text to EducateQuotes() for
        processing. This is mainly for the benefit of people who write
        posts using Dreamweaver, which substitutes this entity for any
        literal quote char. The one and only way to invoke this option
        is to use the letter shortcuts for the smarty_pants attribute;
        the shortcut for this option is "w" (for Dream_w_eaver).
        (Suggested by Jonathon Delacour.)

    +   Added <script> to the list of tags in which SmartyPants doesn't
        touch the contents.

    +   Fixed a very subtle bug that would occur if a quote was the very
        last character in a body of text, preceded immediately by a tag.
        Lacking any context, previous versions of SmartyPants would turn
        this into an opening quote mark. It's now correctly turned into
        a closing one.

    +   Opening quotes were being curled the wrong way when the
        subsequent character was punctuation. E.g.: "a '.foo' file".
        Fixed.

    +   New MT global template tag: <$MTSmartyPantsVersion$>
        Prints the version number of SmartyPants, e.g. "1.2".


    1.1: Wed Feb 5, 2003

    +   The smart_dashes template attribute now offers an option to
        use "--" for *en* dashes, and "---" for *em* dashes.

    +   The default smart_dashes behavior now simply translates "--"
        (dash dash) into an em-dash. Previously, it would look for
        " -- " (space dash dash space), which was dumb, since many
        people do not use spaces around their em dashes.

    +   Using the smarty_pants attribute with a value of "2" will
        do the same thing as smarty_pants="1", with one difference:
        it will use the new shortcuts for en- and em-dashes.

    +   Closing quotes (single and double) were incorrectly curled in
        situations like this:
            "<a>foo</a>",
        where the comma could be just about any punctuation character.
        Fixed.

    +   Added <kbd> to the list of tags in which text shouldn't be
        educated.
