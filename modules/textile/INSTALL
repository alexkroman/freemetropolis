Installation of textile.module could not be simpler. Simply copy the
textile directory, containing the textile.module file and
smartypants-php and textilephp directories to your Drupal modules
directory. Then log into your site and go to the module configuration
page and enable the Textile module. If you are using the title module,
you will need to ensure that Textile comes before the title module on
the filter ordering page.

NOTE: Drupal's current filter implementation is not the most efficient
and will be reworked in upcoming releases. This module should perform
well on most sites; however, extremely busy sites may experience a
performance hit (especially with caching disabled) performing all of
the regular expression matching involved with Textile.
