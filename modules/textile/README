The Textile module allows you to enter content using Textile, a
simple, plain text syntax that is filtered into valid XHTML. The
filter tips found at
<http://your_drupal_site/filter/tips#filter-textile> provides syntax
descriptions and examples. If you are using the title module, you will
need to ensure that Textile comes before the title module on the
filter ordering page.

More information about Textile can be found at the Textile home page
<http://textism.com/tools/textile/>.

NOTE: Drupal's current filter implementation is not the most efficient
and will be reworked in upcoming releases. This module should perform
well on most sites; however, extremely busy sites may experience a
performance hit (especially with caching disabled) performing all of
the regular expression matching involved with Textile.
